                <h2>Why Dumb Exists</h2>
                <p>Dumb was created to bypass the paywall—the growing wall between people and the news they need. We believe access should be earned by curiosity, not gated by subscriptions.</p>
                <p>Behind the simple UI is a stubborn mission: unstick journalism from ad pixels and corporate choke points, surface the story without the squeeze, and make sure a reader in a dorm room has the same shot at the truth as someone with ten subscriptions.</p>
                <p>We build with restraint and a bias for clarity. No dark patterns, no engagement traps, just a clean path from headline to understanding. Dumb is the small rebellion that keeps the web honest—one app, one article, one bypass at a time.</p>
                <p>Every release is a conversation with our users: what’s blocked, what’s broken, what’s worth knowing right now. That feedback loop shapes our roadmap more than investor decks ever could.</p>
                <p>We’re not trying to replace journalism. We’re trying to give it room to breathe—free from the friction that keeps readers out and keeps hard reporting unseen. If a story matters, it shouldn’t be hidden. Dumb is how we keep it in the light.</p>
